Tests are located in tests & more directory

To use project just copy-paste files from src and h directory and copy-paste test that u want to see
Tests are not mine. They are taken from the box from previous generations (link: https://m.box.com/shared_item/https%3A%2F%2Fapp.box.com%2Fs%2F0r50je333z1qyypz0h3rm0iqb9s0d64f)

In case box is ever taken down, test will not be lost.



Notes:
	1. If there is a need to print output of program to file and not console, use comand: [name of project].exe > [name of output file].[extension]
			example: os1.exe > out.txt
		The output file will be in BCC folder if you use VM to do your project
