for some unknown reason i can restrict size od stack to max 64KB, if i do so, the whole project doesnt work
also, for some stupid reason if stack size for pcb is set between 32768 and 32782, the project doesnt work, but for any other number it does...
running public test 11 fails after running for some time; my theory is that 2 threads get to the same time in cout<<... section and that breaks running program; 
	1 possible demonstration of this theory is if all wait calls on mutex m send 0 as arg, the program finishes
