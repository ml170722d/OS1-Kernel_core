IMPORTANT:
	syncPrint.cpp are not the same at "tests & more" and "tests & more\debugging"
	for debugging use syncPrint.cpp at tests & more\debugging
	
Note:
	files required to run test for timer are syncPrint.cpp, consts.h, kIntLock.h and kIntLock.cpp, test_int.cpp and tests.h
	also before program main in main.cpp paste:

#ifdef MEMORY_LEAK_TEST
#undef MEMORY_LEAK_TEST
int counter = 0;

void* operator new(unsigned size) {
	void* ret = malloc(size);
	if (ret == 0)
		exit(1); //Out of mem
	counter++;
	return ret;
}

void operator delete(void* loc) {
	if (loc != 0) {
		counter--;
		free(loc);
	}
}
#endif
	
	if memory leak test is needed (like in current state od project)
		
	location of test files tests & more\debugging (needed for all)
	location of test files tests & more\debugging\timer (tests for timer only)
