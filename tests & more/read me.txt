test_100_processes and test_200_processes can't be tested in console, they must be tested in output file
test_100_processes and test_200_processes work, but console can't be valid test because there is to much output lines

to create output file, in command line enter name_of_project.exe > name_of_output file.txt
output txt file is located in BCC folder of project

added test_270_processes output file; everything is correct!

NOTE:
	to test yourself, just change N value in main.cpp and if you want to check timer, commant or uncomment cout(s)
	if starting 100 or more processes, there should be as few outputs to console (cout<<...) as possible; something breks console after specific number of lines outputed!



NOTE:
	at this point, core of system is working as it should!!!
